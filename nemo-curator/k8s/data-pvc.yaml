# PersistentVolumeClaim for NeMo Curator workshop data
# Provides shared storage for raw downloads, intermediate curation
# artifacts, and final curated output across all workshop stages.
#
# StorageClass gp3 provisions AWS EBS gp3 volumes (3000 IOPS baseline,
# 125 MB/s throughput) which is more than sufficient for JSONL I/O.
# 100Gi gives headroom for the raw Wikipedia dump (~4-6 GB uncompressed
# at 50K articles) plus all intermediate outputs.
